I want to point out that Rachel Carson's official biographer, a woman who
interviewed over 150 of Carson's colleagues and closest friends, pored
over her
personal correspondence and journals, and had access to every corner of
her
life, states unequivocally that she found no evidence to support the claim
that
Carson was a homosexual woman.
