 Comments: Dear Grace: I feel deep sympathy for your loss of Johnnie as
your life companion. I know her presence with you was a huge part
 of your soul's joy and expression in the world. Her foibles, her
stubbornness, her unique, no bullshit, cut to the chase style of
interacting was
 just a part of why so many of us who knew her felt honored to do so.
Although she and I were in each others calendars only intermittently, I
 felt richer in my life for knowing her and whenever I thought of her it
always made me smile. She was such an enigma, she pulled no
 punches, tolerated no insincerities and was extraordinarily loyal to her
causes and her friends. To me, Johnnie lived by the motto "If you're not
 making waves, you're not kicking hard enough." I know that wherever she
is now in this vast sea of space she's definately still making
 waves.

 Comments: Grace, You and johnnie were two people that I could always
count on. My deepest sympathy at this time. Johnnie is in a beeter
 place now and maybe she can keep a better eye on me. Thank you for all

 Comments: I worked with Johnnie on NOW publications for years. NOW had a
policy of using only union printers and we were always
 pointing out that printers like Johnnie couldn't be in a union because of
discriminatory policies against women and that we needed to change
 the union only policy to give feminists priority for bidding jobs (our
own brand of affirmative action). Johnnie was a good ally to have and
 Toni, LA NOW, and activists on the side of the angels could always count
on Johnnie to be a willing fighter against all odds. She could take it
 on the chin, smile, and come back at cha. Johnnie, I'll miss you.

 Comments: I never had the pleasure of meeting Johnnie, however I did have
the chance to meet some of the people she touched. What I
 know of Johnnie she was a kind hearted, caring lady, who donated her life
to helping others. To those who didn't know her, she may not be
 here helping fight for what we all believe in but I know she is above
fighting for us all there. Johnnie is and always will be an inspiration to
me
 and all of us for what she believed in and what she stood for. God Bless
you. Johnnie You were the one who held your head high. You saw
 what was not what could be. You were there for Grace and all. You led the
way. You will be missed. Now it's time for you to be free.

 Comments: Johnnie was from the very beginning a take-no-prisoners, no-
holds barred friend. She brooked no nonsense and certainly did
 not suffer fools lightly. She was totally unlike anyone I'd ever met
before. She was a power point, a center to each activity on which she
 turned her attention. She held herself as an example that amazing things
can happen if you just set your mind to it. She was magnetic. I found
 that I would watch her and listen to her stories with great attention.
She inspired great loyalties and great frustrations. Leaders do that. And
 lead she did; always at the head of the parade; stepping out in front to
support what she believed in. Fire, passion, insight and a mixed bag of
 foibles - that was the Johnnie I knew. She was a special friend who gave
subtle, special gifts and I will miss her greatly.

 Comments: I feel lucky to have been a part of documenting Johnnie's
recollections of her life. I am glad that what she stood for and lived for
 will be immortalized for all those who weren't able to meet her in
person. It was an honor for me to have spent time with some one who
 unselfishly has done so much for a community that has too long been
misrepresented, misunderstood, and condemned. Johnnie, you will be
 missed, but your life has given so many others a foundation on which to
build. Thank you.

 Comments: I came to the site because of a posting on H-Minerva. Johnie
sounded like an interesting woman and I wanted to learn more
 about her. Her photos inspired me to leave a message. It's strange. It's
like she spoke to me through those photos. I can well imagine she was
 an extraordinary woman whose loss will be deeply felt. Please accept the
heart felt condolences of this stranger.
