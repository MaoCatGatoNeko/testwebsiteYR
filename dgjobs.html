DIRECTOR OF MAQUILADORA PROJECT
AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE (AFSC)
<br>
The Maquiladora Project is one component of the AFSC's Mexico-U.S. Border
Program.  The Border Program addresses issues such as immigrants' rights;
causes and consequences of migration; international workers' rights in the
context of economic globalization and the operation of transnational
corporations; trade liberalization and economic integration; patterns of
economic development and their impact on poor communities on both sides of
the border; and Mexico-U.S. relations as they touch on these issues.
<br>
The Maquiladora Project focuses on the impact of the maquiladora industry
on labor rights, health and safety, community environmental health, and
the
employment of young women as a vulnerable labor force. 
The Director of the Maquiladora Project
will be based at the Texas-Mexico border.
