<p>We mourn the passing of world War II veteran, Johnnie Phelps,
a brave, wonderful, kind and generous woman, who later headed the
Los Angeles chapter of the <em>National Organization for Women</em>,
providing key strategic support and morale for the infamous 1980
lesbian harassment and witchhunting incident aboard the <em>Norton
Sound</em>. Way before Ellen, Johnnie stood up to then General
Eisenhower, outing herself as a lesbian. The story appears in
Randy Shilts' masterpiece of investigative journalism, <em>Conduct
Unbecoming</em>, and ApolloMedia's follow-up CD-ROM of the same
name, excerpted below.</p>
<p><img src="../-retter/johnnie2.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="285" height="240">Your courage was
inspirational to a generation of women whose lives you touched,
and for whom your ideals and bravery stood as a firm and
welcoming beacon in overwhelming and dangerous darkness. Our
deepest regrets to Grace Bukowski.</p>
<p>The world is a lesser place without you in it Johnnie. Rest in
Peace.</p>

<p>In gay veterans&#146; circles, WAC Sergeant Johnnie Phelps
became legendary for a conversation she had with Eisenhower when
she served on the general&#146;s staff during the postwar
occupation of Europe. Phelps admired Eisenhower as a
soldier&#146;s soldier who genuinely cared for his troops and
would never order them to do something he would not do himself.
Out of respect for Eisenhower, Phelps would never have lied to
him, which was why she knew how to answer the day he called her
into his office and said he had heard reports that there were
lesbians in the WAC battalion. He wanted a list of their names,
he said, so he could get rid of them. That, Phelps suspected,
would be a tall order, since she estimated 95 percent of the WAC
battalion of nine hundred women at that headquarters was lesbian.</p>
<p><img src="../-retter/johnnie3.gif" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10" width="285" height="240">&#147;Yes, sir,&#148; Phelps
said to the general, according to her later account. She would
make the list, if that was the order. Then she reminded
Eisenhower that the WAC battalion at his headquarters was one of
the most decorated in the Army. It performed superbly, had the
fewest unauthorized absences, the least number of
venereal-disease cases, and the most infrequent number of
pregnancies of any WAC group anywhere. Getting rid of the
lesbians would mean losing competent file clerks, typists, and a
large share of the headquarters&#146; key personnel.
&#147;I&#146;ll make your list,&#148; Phelps concluded in her
crackling North Carolina accent, &#147;but you&#146;ve got to
know that when you get the list back, my name&#146;s going to be
first.&#148; 
<p>
[In an interview, Grace Bukowski added that Johnnie told her that
the
secretary of the batallion, also said, "Excuse me General, but MY name
will 
be first, because I'm going to be typing the list." - Note by Yolanda 
Retter].
