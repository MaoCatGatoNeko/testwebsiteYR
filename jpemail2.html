 Comments: Dear Grace. I have seen "Before Stonewall" many times and each
time I find Johnnie Phelps' courage and strength beyond
 inspiring. I have just read her bio and am glad that such a unique person
would have a life of such accomplishment to her communities. What
 an extrordinary life she had and we are all better off for it than we
would have been otherwise. I hope this finds you in good health and
spirits.
 With Respect, Christopher Mitchell.

 Comments: Grace & Rachelle, Even though I did not ever meet Johnnie in
the flesh I feel as if I knew her personally through you two. You
 told me so many of her stories and accomplishments that I couldn't help
but learn how to be a stronger person. I admire her more than anyone
 I've ever met and feel blessed to have "met" her though you. All My Love,
Sandra

 Comments: I recently watched Before Stonewall, maybe for the hundredth
time. As countless others, I was very much impressed with Ms.
 Phelps story. Hoping to learn more about this great war heroine, I
searched for her name in the Web only to find out that she passed away a
 few months ago. It made me feel very sad. I wish I had the opportunity to
tell her how much her courage inspired me. Johnnie Phelps' story
 should be taught in history classes in every school. She is a role model
for our youth, gay or straight.

 Comments: Just heard of Johnny's passing through the L-Plus list. Norma
and I have many memories of sitting across the dining room table
 with Johnny and Grace listening to Johnny tell her stories while she
smoked those More cigarettes. We remember her untiring efforts in LA
 NOW and California NOW. Carol hired Johnny to print her first Annual
Report in her PR position at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, and the
 extra paper from that job went to good use for various gay rights groups'
flyers for years to come. Norma especially remembers how Grace
 and Johnny would put her up in the room above their shop where she'd
sleep for a couple of days to recoup from the struggles (turns out
 Norma had myasthenia gravis which was the cause of that extreme fatigue).
Norma thanks you, Grace, for your support in the late '70s. We
 wish you well. Carol and Norma

 Comments: I have much admiration and respect for Johnnie. Her spirit will
be with the gay & lesbian movement of the future. Because of
 Johnnie and the people that worked with her, the movement will effect
positive change and human dignity for all.

 Comments: This is long-winded, which should suprise no one who knows me,
but i just started writing about Johnnie and this is what
 happened. When i first met Johnnie, i was just twenty, if that. She had
to remind me of the time and place when i saw her again, years later-the
 Los Angeles Women’s Building, at a benefit concert i had agreed to do for
a fledgling organization that Johnnie was trying to get of f the
 ground, the Alcoholism Center for Women. I thought it was really a good
cause and i felt bad for all those women with drug and drinking
 problems that i had seen over the years, through the considerable fog of
my own alcoholism, yet to become distinct and unambiguous to me.
 Many years of drinking, finally sobriety and a chance contact with the
musician friend i had done this benefit with resulted in my being asked
 to participate in another concert, for the same organization, some twenty
years later. It was through this symphony of irony that i was
 reintroduced to Johnnie. Johnnie was the kind of person one could trust,
at once and completely. Her sense of ethics and justice and her
 kindness and love were so obvious and reassuring that even deeply
suspicious people like myself found no obstacle to putting complete trust
in
 her experience and opinions. Not that i didn’t disagree with her
opinions, of which she seemed to have an endless supply. Our first
 disagreement happened in our first conversation-how could it not? A
conversation about the politics of the State of California between two
 incredibly opinionated woman, one an exemplary WW II veteran and the
other, a Vietnam Era anti-war protester could not have gone
 otherwise. But she taught me how to disagree with someone without losing
respect for them or dismissing them. “I’m not gonna tell you how
 to live your life, but...” was how she’d address my concerns, giving me
the inch or so of room that i needed to hear what she said without
 feeling that she was being domineering. in this way, Johnnie taught me
how to perceive all the shades of gray between the extremes of my
 own dogmatic convictions. Johnnie also guided me through the fairly
treacherous terrain of turning 40 years old. Her being 30 years my senior
 helped, but what helped more was that her life and experiences and
decisions seemed to fly in the face of conventional attitudes about women
 and aging and what one is supposed to do at what age. I told her that i
wanted to be her when i grew up and she laughed. I still feel that way
 and hope that i can grow into half the incredible human being that she
was. Thank you, Johnnie. Grace and Rachelle: my heart is with you

 Comments: Tried to leave a message before. This may be a second message.
Johnnie was strong but vulnerable in ways most people missed.
 She was the essence of "what you see is what you get". There was no
duplicity about her. Her plainspoken honesty was always refreshing.
 My warmest thoughts are with Grace.

 Comments: I'm too sad to say much more than my heart hurts from the loss
of Johnnie. I've been talking to her every so often over the past
 year and could hear this day coming. I just didn't want it to come.
Please give Grace my love and tell her that if she needs ANYTHING to let
 me know. Love, Mary Lou (and Kathy who isn't home yet but loved Johnnie
too.)

 Comments: What sad news to hear. Thank you for letting us know. Johnnie
was a beautiful brave, passionate and tireless fighter who will
 live in our hearts forever. Her courage was inspirational to a generation
of women whose lives she touched, and for whom her ideals and
 bravery stood as a firm and welcoming beacon in overwhelming and
dangerous darkness. Our deepest regrets to Grace. And our deepest
 sympathy to you too. We met Johnnie a couple of times, and in that short
space, we really loved her too. We have created a web page in
 Johnnie's honor. The address is http://xq.com/johnnie/ Regards, Clinton

didn't know all of that. She didn't blow her own horn much. Thanks

folks. Roberta
