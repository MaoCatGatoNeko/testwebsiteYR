ON LESBIAN AND GAY ARCHIVES

Institute/International Gay and Lesbian Archives, Los Angeles.

According to one source, there are over 110 lesbian/gay archives and 
collections in the U.S. and other countries (*).  Some of these 
collections 
are held by universities, but most belong to grass roots community groups 
and organizations. How they began and how they keep going is a history in 
itself. The Los Angeles International Gay and Lesbian Archives, one of the
largest in 
the world, began in Jim Kepner's California apartment in 1942, The Lesbian
Herstory 
Archives in New York began in the early 70's in Joan Nestle's apartment.
Throughout the 
years, 
women and men with the foresight to see the meaning and importance of our 
history collected documents and artifacts with great passion, dedication 
and little if any, outside funding.
<p>
Our history is still generally unavailable and invisible and much of it 
lies uncatalogued in the thousands of articles, photos, clippings,
posters, oral 
interviews, etc. held by various collections.  Most of this material 
cannot be found in mainstream libraries or archives. 
Most lesbian/gay archives rely on volunteers and donations of time, money
and materials. Consequently, much 
of the material is uncatalogued and unavailable both to the community and 
to researchers. In addition, the vast amount of material that was
generated after Stonewall, is now old 
enough to be at risk and without preservation, much of it will eventually 
be lost. Older materials such as those from the turn of the century are in 
even greater need of preservation.
<p>
The ONE International Gay and Lesbian Archives has been proactive in 
collecting materials invaluable to lesbian and gay history.  It is now 
attempting to move into the next phase: preserving this information and 
making it visible and available to the community, to academics and to 
people using the Internet. It is also interested in networking with other 
collections, offering support and expertise in maintenance, preservation 
and the organizing of information. One goal of this networking is to 
assemble a national database of the holdings of lesbian and gay 
collections.
<p>
These archives and collections contain invaluable evidence of our presence 
and contributions throughout the centuries and this information is useful 
in a number of areas. It is a positive 
source of self-esteem and pride for lesbians and gays. In this evidence, 
younger people struggling with their sexual identities can find role 
models, an important factor for the many that contemplate suicide.   
Information in these archives has been used to assist in 
lesbian and 
gay related legal cases whose outcomes affect the entire 
community. Movie 
producers use the collections to research films that will educate both 
our communities and open-minded heterosexuals. 
<p>
The information in these collections provides evidence of
our
individual 
and collective presence and resistance before there was a movement, our
struggles and 
successes before and after Stonewall, our diversity, our cultures and our 
dreams. These collections and archives serve as educational vehicles and
research sources for the 
lesbian and gay communities, for academics and anyone interested in 
our history.
<p>
Community archives welcome your volunteer time and donations of money
and any 
and all 
materials (in any medium) pertaining to lesbian/gay/bi/transgender history 
and culture. REMEMBER, if it's an LGBT artifact (magazines, 
flyers, personal photos, videos, political t-shirts and buttons, books,
diaries, your activist 
appointment book, a group or organization's papers and records) DON'T
throw it out, donate it to your nearest 
LGBT archive!
