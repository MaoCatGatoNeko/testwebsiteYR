* In May 1994, Chevrei Tikvah (Cleveland, OH) sponsored
a lecture by Dr.
                    Klaus Muller, Professor of European Studies at the
University of
                    Amsterdam, consultant to the U.S. Holocaust Memorial
Museum, and
                    renowned scholar on anti-gay Nazi policies and
persecution. The
                    congregation also presented, for the first time
outside the Holocaust
                    Museum, <b>the remarkable documentary film of gay
Holocaust survivors
                    entitled, "We Were Marked With a Big 'A'," (a German
pejorative applied to
                    homosexuals).</b> 
                    With an admission charge of only canned goods or a
small cash donation,
                    Dr. Muller's lecture drew over 260 people, of whom
over 82 percent were
                    from outside the congregation - specifically the
lesbian
and gay interfaith and
                    Jewish communities...
