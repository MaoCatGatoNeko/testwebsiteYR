<h3> A latina lesbian activist's survival guide:<br>
o, mejor dicho, activism de-mystified, de-glorified &amp; de-graded</h3>
<p>  
it all begins with a driving desire for justice which turns into an untamable vision that seems manageable and practical yet intangible.  before you lung and wreck a decent life (yours), consider some thots & tactics from one who lives la radical revoluci&#243;n que alg&#250;n d&#237;a se le ocurri&#243;:
</p>  
<p>   
&#8226;  the odds are against you.  most likely, you don&#8217;t have the resources, support, history, or allies that are vital to your plan of acci&#243;n.
</p> 
&#8226;  no matter how pc it is to dig the latina lesbian nation, &#8220;they&#8221; could really give a shit.  &#8220;they&#8221; care most deeply about &#8220;their&#8221; advancement, not about you or your agenda or your nada, mi&#8217;ja.  tokenism is still close to home.
<p>
&#8226;  about those nice anti-racists&#8211;if they walk their talk and you don&#8217;t feel like una decoraci&#243;n on their lapel, use them.
</p>
&#8226;  when you&#8217;re trying to get into on of those we&#8217;ve-never-seen-a-latina-lesbian-in-this-environment types of situations, expect to do intense legwork that will pave the way for others in the future, but maybe not just yet for you.
<p>
&#8226;  use that grubby white-racist guilt to your advantage.
</p>
&#8226;  if you&#8217;re working with your latina lesbian familia, don&#8217;t expect support.
<p>
&#8226;  there really are evil people and some of them are in your community.  don&#8217;t let the greedy, dishonest, lying, classist backstabbing dirty political players alienate you from your dream or from the people who share it.
</p>
&#8226;  for all your merits, you&#8217;re just una exagerada, a chronic malcontent, a trouble-making escandalosa, an obnoxious gravel in everyone&#8217;s shoe.  the world would be so much smoother if you&#8217;d just shut up.
<p>
&#8226;  regardless of how grand your scheme is, it will most likely mean that you&#8217;ll end up waiting in line at kinko&#8217;s or office depot to photocopy your earth-shaking documents.  brace yourself&#8211;they could be out of that &#8220;solar yellow&#8221; paper you envisioned.
</p>
<p>    
&#8226;  the most humiliating experience of all:  selecting the appropriate stamp at the post office.  if you hate u.s. flags, wooden ducks, males, buildings & &#8220;love&#8221; stamps, be prepared to suffer.  DO NOT say &#8220;fuck&#8221; within hearing range of your local postal clerks.
</p>
<p>   
&#8226;  oh yeah, a few possible side effects:  blurry vision, sleep deprivation, extreme poverty, messy house & burnt food, bureaucratic frustrations, diminished sex life, continual injustice, deteriorating health & no social life to speak of.  it&#8217;s all so grand!
</p> 
<p>    
&#8226;  keep your vision in check.  it may all be worth it.
</p>
<p>   
*(una escandalosa who&#8217;s been jailed & hailed & ostracized & tokenized to no avail)*
